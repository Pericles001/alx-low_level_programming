Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/P3IGlnHQyySuo9hPXasUAA "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   How to use arguments passed to your program
-   What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
-   How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

Requirements
------------

### General

-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
-   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-   You are not allowed to use global variables
-   No more than 5 functions per file
